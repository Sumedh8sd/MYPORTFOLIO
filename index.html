        <p>Name : BANK CHURN MODELLING</p>
        <P>Bank churn prediction model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank (churn). </P>
        <P>By analyzing factors such as transaction history, account activity, customer demographics, and interaction patterns, the model identifies key indicators that contribute to churn. Using these insights, banks can proactively identify at-risk customers and take targeted retention strategies to prevent churn, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing revenue loss. This predictive model serves as a valuable tool for banks to optimize their customer retention efforts and enhance overall business performance.</P>
